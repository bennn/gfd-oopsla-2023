What does t-test say about untyped vs. deep-typed configs?
(code/tt.rkt)

Especially curious about these first few, because they all
have black holes => likely untyped faster than typed.
But for `forth` at least, the runtimes are VERY close in an
absolute sense!

  forth      ((student 0) (welch 0))
  mbta       ((student 0) (welch 0))
  zombie     ((student 0) (welch 0))
  dungeon    ((student 0) (welch 0))
  take5      ((student 0) (welch 0))
  acquire    ((student 0) (welch 0))

0 => different (this is all rounded aggressively, to 2 decimal places)

The rest is nothing surprising:

  sieve      ((student 58) (welch 58))
  morsecode  ((student 0) (welch 0))
  fsm        ((student 0) (welch 0))
  fsmoo      ((student 0) (welch 0))
  jpeg       ((student 0) (welch 0))
  lnm        ((student 0) (welch 0))
  suffixtree ((student 0) (welch 0))
  kcfa       ((student 35) (welch 36))
  snake      ((student 0) (welch 0))
  tetris     ((student 0) (welch 0))
  synth      ((student 80) (welch 81))
