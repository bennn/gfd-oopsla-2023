The definitions of successful migration paths enables rephrasing the
questions from~\ref{sec:intro} in terms of strategies:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$Q_X$] Is strategy $X$ successful in the context of the elimination of
  performance bottlenecks via migration?

\item[$Q_{X/Y}$] Is strategy $X$ more successful than strategy $Y$ in this
  context?
\end{itemize}

Answering $Q_X$ boils down to determining the success and failures of
$\mode{X}$, the rational-programmer mode of $X$, for all
performance-debugging scenarios. If, for a large number of scenarios,
$\mode{X}$ charts migration paths that are strictly successful, the answer
is positive. Essentially, the large number of scenarios is evidence that
when a rational programmer reacts to profiler feedback following $X$, it is
likely to benefit  while tuning the performance of 
mixed-typed code. Notably, the above description uses the strict notion of
success, which sets a high standard of success. Hence, the rational
programmer not only manages to tune performance at a tolerable level but
each suggestion of its strategy brings the rational programmer closer to
its target. Swapping the notion of strict success for $k$-loose success
relaxes this high standard, and offers answers to $Q_X$ when allowing for
some bounded flexibility in how well the intermediate suggestions of
$X$ help the rational programmer.   

While an answer to $Q_X$ constitutes an evaluation of a strategy $X$ for interpreting
profiler feedback in absolute terms, an answer to $Q_{X/Y}$ reveals the
relative value of $X$ versus another strategy $Y$. Answering this second
question asks whether the proportion of scenarios where $\mode{X}$ charts a
successful path but  $\mode{Y}$ does not is higher that the proportion of
scenarios where  $\mode{Y}$ charts a successful path but $\mode{X}$ does not.
 Imporantly, when $\mode{Y}$ is the $randomkw{}$ strategy, if
the answer to $Q_X$ is positive, then it invalidates the null-hypothesis,
i.e., that the success of $X$ is because of sheer luck.
Of course, the answer may not be clear cut as $X$ and $Y$ may
perform equally well in most scenarios, or may have complementary success 
records. Again, relaxing the notion of success by different factors $k$
may help distinguish  $X$ and $Y$ based on the quality of the feedback
they produce.


In sum, the process for answering $Q_X$ and $Q_{X/Y}$ rests on the
following experimental plan:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a large and diverse corpus of performance-debugging scenarios;
\item Calculate the migration paths for each mode of the rational
  programmer for each scenario;
\item Compute and compare the successes and failures of the modes.  
\end{enumerate}
