object level:

- the fsp works well if used with an optimistic strategy
- the statistical profiler with optimistic works well when the
    performance overhead is small for all configurations of the
    program

- shallow/transient have almost no benefit except for special
  situations and small programs 

meta level:

- the rational programmer method has once again shows its value for
  the evaluation of programming-language-tool pragmatics

future work:

- shallow fsp?

- how this all changes when the compiler knows more optimizations 

- profiling is not enough
  - black holes
  - even when we ignore black holes, profiling information does not
    get the rational programmer to tolerable performance from a
    performance-debugging scenario


- rational programmer: experiment should be repeated in other settings


% Shallow / transient gets no benefit from boundary profiling,
% some benefit from statistical.
% How about a shallow FSP?


%% MF what does this mean? 
%% Would a simpler approach work just as well [CITE vmil]?
