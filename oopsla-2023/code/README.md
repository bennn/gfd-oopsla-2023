code
===

all sorts of code, analysis scripts, stats

this is the original code to build the paper
the artifact (../artifact) has similar code for auditing

- base.rkt: define benchmarks, configurations, overhead, %, ....
- success.rkt: analyze trails for success / failure
- tex.rkt: render output
- georges.rkt: play with statistics, audit runtimes

- shallow-help.rkt: quick info about shallow configs / profiles ... what good is shallow?!
- stuck.rkt: where in the lattice do configs get stuck?
