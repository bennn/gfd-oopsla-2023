Turning the sketch from section~\ref{sec:ideas} into a large-scale automated
experiment requires the formalization of rational programmers. In turn, this
task demands (1) strategy components that identify (2) the next migration step,
plus (3) a collection of performance-debugging scenarios. As the preceding
section implies, parts~2 and~3 are tied together. Every rational programmer
recognizes whether a given program is a performance-debugging scenario; if so,
it applies a strategy to the profiler feedback and migrates the program---which
should yield a performant program or another performance-debugging scenario.
The preceding section also implies that a strategy's response is one of three
possibilities: (1) to signal failure; (2) to add types and to specify their
enforcement regime (deep, shallow); or (3) to toggle from one regime to
another. Hence it is possible to specify strategies independently of the
scenarios per se. Once this pieces are formalized, it is possible to turn the
generic research question of the introduction into questions with a quantitative
nature. 

The rest of the section provides precise definitions for all these elements of
the experiment.  Section~\ref{subsec:strategies} presents the profiling
strategies that induce the modes of the rational programmer for the experiment.
Section~\ref{subsec:lattice} defines the migration lattice of a program, which
the modes navigate, characterizes the performance-debugging scenarios that serve
as starting navigation points, and lays out the criteria for a successful or
failed navigation. Finally, section~\ref{subsec:questions} leverages these
definitions to formalize the experimental questions and the experimental
procedure that answers them.
