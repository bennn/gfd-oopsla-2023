The work in this paper touches a range of existing strands of research. At
the object-level, the main motivation for this paper is prior research on
the performance issues of sound gradual typinh; while two significant
sources of inspiration are research on gradual type migration and
profiling technique.  At the meta-level, this work builds on and extends
prior results on the rational programmer method.   

\paragraph{The Rational Programmer}

 \citep{lksfd-popl-2020,lgfd-icfp-2021} propose the rational programmer as
 an empirical method for evaluating the role of blame in debugging
 different kinds of logical mistakes with software contracts and gradual types. However,
 the ideas behind the rational programmer go beyond debugging logical
 mistakes. In essence, the rational programmer is a general methodological
 framework for the systematic investigation of the pragmatics of
 programming languages and tool, i.e., the value of the various aspects of a
 language or a tool in the context of a specific task. In that sense,
 Lazarek et al.'s work focuses on a single context: debugging logical
 mistakes. This work shows how the rational programmer applies to
 another context: performance tuning and debugging of performance
 bottlenecks. Hence, it shares the language features
 it studies, gradual typing, with Lazarek's work, but it looks at a different aspect of its
 pragmatics. As a result besides contributing to the understanding of the
 value of gradual types, it also provides evidence for the generality of
 the rational programmer method itself.  

\paragraph{Performance Tuning and Gradual Typing} 

Deep types performance: Pycket, Corpse Reviver,

(shallow
checks come in a variety of
forms~\cite{grmhn-vmil-2019,rmhn-ecoop-2019,glfd-pj-2022,lgmvpk-pj-2023}
inspired by Reticulated's transient
semantics~\cite{vksb-dls-2014,vss-popl-2017,v-thesis-2019})

Alternate semantics: concrete, Nom, Thorn, StrongScript, SafeTS;
Static Python; monotonic; Pyret. See toplas.



\paragraph{Gradual Type Migration}



\paragraph{Performance Tuning with Profilers}

profiling strategy for transient: run once for each type, set of hot types => hot config;
mention too when discussing FSP for transient
