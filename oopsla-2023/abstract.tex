  Sound migratory typing envisions a safe and smooth refactoring of
  untyped code bases to typed ones.  However, the cost of enforcing safety
  with run-time checks is often prohibitively high, thus performance
  regressions are a likely occurrence.  Additional types can often recover
  performance, but choosing the right points to type is difficult because
  of the exponential size of the migratory typing lattice. In principal
  though, migration could be guided by an effective interpretation of feedback from
  profiling tools.  To examine this hypothesis, this paper  follows the
  rational programmer method, and reports on the results of an experiment
  on tens of thousands of performance-debugging scenarios via 15
  deterministic strategies for turning profiler output into an actionable
  next step.  Specifically, by far the most effective strategy is to
  greedily pursue deep types; it succeeds in 60\% of scenarios when at
  most one performance degradation is tolerable.
