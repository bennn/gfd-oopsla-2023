Sound migratory typing envisions a safe and smooth refactoring of untyped code
bases to typed ones.
However, the cost of enforcing safety with run-time checks is often
prohibitively high, thus performance regressions are a likely occurrence.
Additional types can often recover performance,
but choosing the right points to type is difficult because
of the exponential size of the migratory typing lattice.
Profiling tools can guide the search systematically.
This paper reports on the results of a rational-programmer experiment on tens
of thousands of performance-debugging scenarios via 15 deterministic strategies
for turning profiler output into an actionable next step.
When it comes to eliminating overhead, by far the most effective strategy is
to greedily pursue strong types; it succeeds in 60\% of scenarios when
one mis-step is allowed.
These results shed light on how well particular uses of profiling tools work
for these performance-debugging issues.
At the same time, the experiment once again confirms the usefulness of the
rational-programmer method.
