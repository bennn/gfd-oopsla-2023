  Sound migratory typing envisions a safe and smooth refactoring of
  untyped code bases to typed ones.  However, the cost of enforcing safety
  with run-time checks is often prohibitively high, thus performance
  regressions are a likely occurrence.  Additional types can often
  recover performance, but choosing the right components to type is difficult
  because of the exponential size of the migratory typing lattice. In
  principal though, migration could be guided by an effective
  interpretation of feedback from profiling tools.  To examine this
  hypothesis, this paper  follows the rational programmer method and
  reports on the results of an experiment on tens of thousands of
  performance-debugging scenarios via seventeen strategies for
  turning profiler output into an actionable next step.  By far the most
  effective strategy is the addition of deep types that eliminate the most
  costly boundaries between typed and untyped components; this strategy
  succeeds in 60\% of scenarios when at most one performance degradation
  is tolerable along the way.
