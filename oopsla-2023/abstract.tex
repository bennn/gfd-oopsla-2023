Sound migratory typing promises a safe and smooth refactoring of untyped code
bases to typed ones. Over the past few years, it has become clear that enforcing
soundness with run-time checks imposes a large performance overhead, too large
to deploy many of the partially typed programs.  Finding a smooth path from a
configuration with performance problems to an acceptable one is difficult due to
the exponential size of the migration lattice. The process requires an effective
interpretation of feedback from profiling tools. This paper reports on the
results of a rational-programmer experiment on tens of thousands of
performance-debugging scenarios. These results shed light on how well particular
uses of profiling tools work for these performance-debugging issues. At the same
time, the experiment once again confirms the usefulness of the
rational-programmer method.
