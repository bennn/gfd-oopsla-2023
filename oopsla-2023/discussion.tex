TODO for scatterplot: x-axis = 1-20, but actual plot goes 1-30 and uses the
last 10 to evenly spread the rest.

1. boundary vs profile total vs profile self, on the whole. scatterplot too,
   boundary usually improves, profile frequently degrades

2. strategies: opt vs con vs .... who wins?

3. random is very successful b/c no dead ends.
   why do the profilers have dead ends?

4. (maybe) implictions of 0-dip, 1-dip, 3-dip, N-dip,
   rare that N improves over 3

5. non-overlapping success / failure.
   if you give us a configuration, can we suggest a best profiler / strategy?
   all-shallow probably fails with boundary, etc

6. head to head plot:
   - opts equiv
   - con never beats opt
   - statistical rarely beats fsm, but sometimes!
